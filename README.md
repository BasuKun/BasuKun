Hello, and welcome to Sebastien's portfolio!

If you're interested in checking out a finished game that has been entirely developed by myself and shipped, then Personal Projects > Finished > Cold Idle will be your best bet. Although the code is old, I've used this project as a way to put into practice everything I was learning throughout the years.

If you're interested in just playing the game, it is available for free on itch.io: https://basukun.itch.io/a-cold-night 
This game starts simple, then more and more complex mechanics are unvealed as you progress!

If you're interesting in checking out my current WIP project, then Personal Projects > In Progress > Dice RPG is your best choice. This features more complex mechanics, systems and custom-made Unity tools for automation.

Happy browsing!
