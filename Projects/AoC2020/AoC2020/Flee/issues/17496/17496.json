    "Description": "I am creating a C# application and using.\nI know flee can be used for built-in system functions.\nHowever, I want to use the Between function with flee. \"The BETWEEN operator is used to select values within a range\"as below:\n\n  public static class Ext\n    {\n        public static bool Between(this int source, int low, int high)\n        {\n            return source.CompareTo(low) >= 0 && source.CompareTo(high) <= 0;\n        }\n    }\n\nIs there any way I can work with my own custom functions?",
