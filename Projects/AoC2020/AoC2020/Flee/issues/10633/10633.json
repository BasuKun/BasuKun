    "Description": "Used the above call to compile an boolean expression of the type NIGHT && DAY where NIGHT=false and DAY=true in c#. \n Sometimes I need to make the varaibale names NIGHT_$1, or DAY_$4, both set to false. When I compile the expression again it comes back with an exception, of \"Unexpected character $.... \".  I really need them in the variable names, as the $1 etc represent replacement variables where the $ variables are replaced by other values at a later date, for example NIGHT_$1 could become NIGHT_192.168.3.1.  Is it a case that $ is not allowed in variable names. if $ is not allowed in the variable name, is their some other special characters which can be used like % for instance, or Â£, or __1.",
