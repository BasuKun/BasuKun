    "ClosedComment": "The CreateDynamic method creates an expression which evaluates to an Object.  So the expression's result type is \"Dynamic\" as in it is not fixed as is the case with a generic expression.\n\nFlee itself is statically typed: It always needs to know the types of things in an expression.  If you want to be able to use variables without first defining them, you should look at \"on-demand\" variables (see the examples page).  Hook the Resolve events on the variable collection.  Flee will raise the events when it needs the types and values for each variable it encounters.",

    "Description": "Okay,\n \nI have an express x+5 and x is not defined so when using the following code \n \nIDynamicExpression d = ExpressionFactory.CreateDynamic(strFormula, m_context);\n \nI get the following exception:\n \n\"ArithmeticOperator: Operation 'Add' is not defined for types 'Object' and 'Int32'\"\n \nNow if I predefine x and add it to m_context then it works fine.  Is there anyway to support dynamic varible creation if a variable does not already exist?\n \nbrian",
