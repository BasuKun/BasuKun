    "Html": "\r\nSince the expression is a string, you can do some manipulations on it before passing it to flee.<br /><br />So you could have an expression like <span class=\"codeInline\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\">ds1.fld1[]</span><br />Which you can transform into <span class=\"codeInline\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\">ds1_fld1_list</span> to get the expression to compile and then map that name back to your original variable in the ResolveVariableValue event.<br /><br />It's not a perfect solution.  I'm currently discussing a possible improvement with another user which will provide a better alternative.<br />",
