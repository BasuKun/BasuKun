I had to change Flee to support different quote character:</p>\r\n<p>// Old string quote character<br>// STRING_LITERAL&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &lt;&lt;&quot;([^&quot;\\r\\n\\\\]|\\\\u[0-9a-f]{4}|\\\\[\\\\&quot;'trn])*&quot;&gt;&gt;<br>STRING_LITERAL&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &lt;&lt;`([^`\\r\\n\\\\]|\\\\u[0-9a-f]{4}|\\\\[\\\\`&quot;'trn])*`&gt;&gt;</p>\r\n<p>It may be hard to read - it is U+0060 instead of U+0022. At the moment, I've modified the source, but this creates the problem with licensing (I hope to be able to use it in a commercial project as well). I was wondering if you were planning to add an option to Flee (I can provide a patch if you want) ExpressionParserOptions which would allow specifying the character used for marking string literals?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>Denis</p>",
