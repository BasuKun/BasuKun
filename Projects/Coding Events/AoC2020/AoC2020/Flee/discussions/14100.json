Obviously, the expression won't compile if the variables don't actually exist.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if you what you need is to parse the expression text and pick out the variable names instead.  That is doable but requires a different approach.<br />",

You can then hook in to the parser and be notified when it hits a variable name.<br /><br />Your request is very similar to nanded's issue (see <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Flee/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=14039\">Identify Variables</a>).
