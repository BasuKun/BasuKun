The expression parsing still failed if variables in my expression had upper case letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found that in a few places in code, ToLower is used without using culture settings specified through context.Options.ParseCulture, as a result it takes the current culture settings of the PC for converting the characters to lower case (e.g. in Find method\r\n in Automaton.vb).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not too familiar with flee code to dare and make changes myself. Can some with more knowledge of this code help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm Regards,<br>\r\n- Vikram Lele</p>\r\n",
