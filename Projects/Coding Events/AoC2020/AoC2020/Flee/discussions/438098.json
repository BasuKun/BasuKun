Looks good.\r<br />\nHowever I have found an issue, and that is I need to validate the expression to check it can compile before evaluating it, otherwise I will get a runtime exception. which crashes the application. I do not mind a graceful failure. Perhaps just wrapping the &quot;evaluate&quot; in a try catch block is enough. However is there a better method to do this, perhaps there is a method in FLEE.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nEd<br />\n",
