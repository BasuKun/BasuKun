My intensions in posting this notice is to gather feedback and find out how many people are interested and able to contribute to such a project.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have never lead a project on CodePlex before, so I could use advice from those who have this kind of experience. I'd even be happy if someone else decided to start the project themselves. \r<br />\n<br />\nI don't have much time to put into this project, so I am afraid I personally would not be able to handle the traffic this project has already demonstrated. Thus, I would need lots of help if I were a coordinator.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, let me know of your interest, by responding to this discussion.<br />\n",
