GEN1=\\&quot;BOOL\\&quot;,GEN2=\\&quot;BOOL\\&quot; and integers with 0. For integers I dont see any problem</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;but for booleans when I use them in the equations like GEN4 = IF(GEN1=TRUE,1,2) its giving exception as string cannot be compared with boolean.</p>\r\n<p>Do you have any solution to solve the problem?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
