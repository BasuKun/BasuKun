I have added DateTime to the ExpressionContext using Imports.AddType(typeof(DateTime),&quot;DateTime&quot;) and can get at other datetime methods but can't get at the extension method. I realize that Extension Methods are really just a compiler trick but would love to get them working in Flee if possible.\r\n\r\n",
