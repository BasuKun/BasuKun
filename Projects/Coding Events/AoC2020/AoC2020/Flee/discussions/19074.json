There're two types of data, one is real time stock quotation, the other is off-line data ( like Earnings Per Share, Gross Margin... etc, but may update weekly or monthly or quarterly).<br />There're about 2000 stocks. If I load all the off line information for each stock on application start, update stock quotation in real time. How to speed up the stock scan for all the stocks ? I think maybe distributed computing or using asynchronous programming model or query the database asynchronously .... any idea ?<br /><br />Regards,<br />AgiChen<br />",
