The code is in my comment at <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/334308/Numerical-Integration-with-Simpsons-Rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/334308/Numerical-Integration-with-Simpsons-Rule</a>.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne thing to watch for is that Flee is written in VisualBasic.Net. VB is case insensitive while C# isn't. \r<br />\nSo something like IDynamicExpression eDynamic = context.CompileDynamic(&quot;sqrt(a)&quot;), like int the flee examples fails in c# , because the method there is Math.Sqrt. Same for other Math. methods, like Cos, Abs, etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo remember to capitalize if you are using c#.<br />\n",
