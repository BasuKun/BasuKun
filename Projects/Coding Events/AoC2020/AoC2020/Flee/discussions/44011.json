I downloaded the FleeDataTableCompute example and with VS 2008 (after conversion of the Solution) everything went OK, but with VS 2005 i'm getting the run-time error Method not found for one of the System.Reflection methods. Does anyone know a solution? Is a .Net-Framework problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nAlejandro \r\n",
