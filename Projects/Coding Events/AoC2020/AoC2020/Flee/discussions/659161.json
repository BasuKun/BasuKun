The list in the documentation and the list on the codeplex page are missing quite a few: sin, cos, tan, log and so on.  I've managed to guess quite a few but i can imagine there are others I can't guess.  Would be very helpful to have a full list.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks.\r<br />\n<br />\nTim<br />\n",
