<div class="wikidoc"><b>Demo</b><br /><br />The demo application shows a practical usage of the library.  It generates an image by evaluating expressions for the red, green, and blue components where the expressions can reference the x and y co-ordinates of the current pixel and use all the functions of the System.Math class.<br /><br />Using the demo will give you a good sense of how fast expressions can be evaluated. Even on my outdated computer at home, I still manage over a million evaluations per second. This means that, on a modern computer, you could generate an 800x600 image in under a second.<br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=Flee&DownloadId=17011" alt="Using&#32;the&#32;demo&#32;to&#32;generate&#32;an&#32;image" title="Using&#32;the&#32;demo&#32;to&#32;generate&#32;an&#32;image" /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
