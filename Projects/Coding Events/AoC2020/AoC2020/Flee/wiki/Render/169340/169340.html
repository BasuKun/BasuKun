<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />Flee is an expression parser and evaluator for the .NET framework.  It allows you to compute the value of string expressions such as <span class="codeInline">sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</span> at runtime.  It uses a custom compiler, strongly-typed expression language, and lightweight codegen to compile expressions directly to IL.  This means that expression evaluation is extremely fast and efficient.  Try out the <a href="https://flee.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=demo&referringTitle=Home">demo</a>, which lets you generate images based on expressions, and see for yourself.<br /><br /><b>Features</b>
<ul><li>Fast and efficient expression evaluation </li>
<li>Small, lightweight library </li>
<li>Compiles expressions to IL using a custom compiler, lightweight codegen, and the DynamicMethod class</li>
<li>Expressions (and the IL generated for them) are garbage-collected when no longer used</li>
<li>Does not create any dynamic assemblies that stay in memory </li>
<li>Backed by a comprehensive suite of unit tests</li>
<li>Culture-sensitive decimal point</li>
<li>Fine-grained control of what types an expression can use</li>
<li>Supports all arithmetic operations including the power (^) operator </li>
<li>Supports string, char, boolean, and floating-point literals </li>
<li>Supports 32/64 bit, signed/unsigned, and hex integer literals </li>
<li>Features a true conditional operator </li>
<li>Supports short-circuited logical operations </li>
<li>Supports arithmetic, comparison, implicit, and explicit overloaded operators</li>
<li>Variables of any type can be dynamically defined and used in expressions</li>
<li>CalculationEngine: Reference other expressions in an expression and recalculate in natural order</li>
<li>Expressions can index arrays and collections, access fields and properties, and call functions on various types</li>
<li>Generated IL can be saved to an assembly and viewed with a disassembler</li></ul>
