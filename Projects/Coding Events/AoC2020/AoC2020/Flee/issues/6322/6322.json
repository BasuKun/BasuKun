    "Description": "I'm trying to support Excel-based expressions, which use 1-based indexes for strings and arrays. Flee seems to only support 0-based indexes for arrays. This is causing my functions to use 1-based indexes and my arrays to use 0-based indexes. It would be nice to have the BaseIndex as an option under ExpressionOptions so the the index base could be changed.\n \nOn a similar note, it would be nice to support string-based array indexes, eg: DataRow[\"SomeColumn\"].\n \nOverall, though, Flee is a top-notch package. Having written expression parsers myself in the past, it's amazing all the features it has.",

Do you still need this feature implemented?\r\n\r\n>On a similar note, it would be nice to support string-based array indexes, eg: DataRow[\"SomeColumn\"].\r\nThere was a bug in my handling of default indexers.  I was only looking at the first one which for a DataRow is the integer one.  This has been fixed.",
