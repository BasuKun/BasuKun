    "Description": "Hi,\n \nGreat library, too bad the assemblies are not strongly signed. This prevents referencing the library from assemblies which have a strong key. \nAny chances of providing strongly signed versions of assemblies? I tried to add the strong key to the source, but it couldn't be compiled since the gramatica DLL is also not strongly signed, and there is no source code for it.\n \nBest regards,\nIgor",
