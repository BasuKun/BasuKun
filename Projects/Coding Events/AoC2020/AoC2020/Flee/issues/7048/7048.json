    "Description": "I have implemented an implicit conversion to a double in a class (DoubleWrapper) that is used as a variable. When I use this class in C#, it works as expected:\n            double dResult = Math.Cos( aDouble );\nHowever the same expression does not work in FLEE.\n            IDynamicExpression expression = context.CompileDynamic( \"Math.Cos( aDouble )\" );\nIt throws an exception indicating it cannot find Cos(DoubleWrapper)\n \nIt seems to me that FLEE should behave the same as C#. Perhaps when it does not find the initial method signature, try to find the first method with a signature that can be used via implicit conversion of the parameter.\n \nThe attached file contains example code to better explain the problem.",
