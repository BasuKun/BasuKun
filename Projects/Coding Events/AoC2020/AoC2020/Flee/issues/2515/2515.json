    "Description": "Eugene,\n \nAs I indicated I was working on a replacement inface so that I could easily swap out my old calculation engine and implement the Flee calc engine to see if it was faster. I have the initial skeloton code complete but before I go any further I would like you to have a look at it. The two really important parts are the events and the Custom Function support. \n \n \nthanks\n \nbrian",

I noticed that Flee throws and exception if I try to parse (x + y) and y has not been defined.  Do all of the variables for and expression need to be defined before you can create and expression?",
